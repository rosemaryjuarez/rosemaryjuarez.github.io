## 

I am currently a MEDS student at the **Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.** I focus on spatial data visualization. I

As an undergrad at UCSB, I was a part of the [Promise Scholar Program](https://promisescholars.sa.ucsb.edu/about), and awarded the Betty Wells Promise Scholar scholarship. The promise scholar is awarded to high-achieving, first-generation students from low-income housing. Students are guaranteed \$120,000 across all four years, allowing for me to prioritize my education.

For graduate school, I also received two fellowships. The Promise Fellowship, issued by the Graduate Division at UC Santa Barbara and donated by Dr. Nien-Tsu Shen, is a total of \$40,000 and is expected to cover the cost of tuition and fees for academic year 2023--24, including summer. Awarded as part of the Promise Scholar Program. The Environmental Data Science Fellowship, issued by the Bren School,recognizes outstanding academic record and will cover the cost of a professional degree.

I have several indoor hobbies. I spend the majority of my time reading and reviewing manga, and adopting and training pet rats.
