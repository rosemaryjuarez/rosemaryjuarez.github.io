    "text": "Purpose\nIn December of 2017, The Thomas fire burned throughout Santa Barbara and Ventura county, creating distress and destructing in its wake. This wildfire was one of multiple wildfires occuring in California, making this a hotter topic throughout the years. As a native Ventura county resident, I have seen the effects this wildfire has caused in the community. Not only did I have to miss school, but my parents and I were forced to shelter indoors as the air quality grew worse. With the sky burning blood red for a few days, and smoke hazes filling up the streets of Oxnard, my curiosity grew more. Now that I have a chance to explore what exactly was going due to having data science experience, I can now vizualize the Thomas’s fire impact through air quality. My interest in collecting the air quality during this time can shed light on the correlation between wildfires and air quality. I want to investigate how the Thomas Fire impacted the AQI in Santa Barbara county using public data provided by US Environmental Protection Agency."

    "text": "Urban heat islands (UHIs) are areas within cities that experience significantly higher temperatures compared to their rural surroundings. This phenomenon arises due to the replacement of natural surfaces with impervious materials, such as asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain heat. UHIs pose substantial risks to human health, particularly those in dense, concrete jungles. Higher temperatures can worsen heat-related illnesses, increase cardiovascular illness risk, and contribute to dehydration. Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and individuals with pre-existing health conditions, are particularly at risk.\nUHI are also tied to environmental concerns, as the intensified heat can also compromise air quality by promoting the formation of ground-level ozone and other pollutants. As heat increases in the city, so does energy consumption. This leads to higher energy-consumption, leading to environmental degradation.\n(heat_index.jpg)\nWe can usually spot out on a map where these heat islands occur, known as an Urban heat index map. However mapping out the index itself is a complicated task. Not only does this require satellite data for surface temperature, we require hourly air temperature. This is both time-consuming and costly. However, a question I have is whether we can use proxy data to get a closer estimate of an urban heat index, using correlation and linear regression to see if this is possible. I also want to investigate whether bird data could provide more accuracy if we applied interpolation on areas where birds cannot be accurately counted.\nI am interested in the correlation between bird count and temperature, as from personal experience, I do not hear birds often during very hot days. Finding out if it is due to the temperature is my interest.\n\n\n\nCan I draw conclusions about the urban heat islands using samples of air temperature and bird sightings?\n\n\n\nThe data was obtained from two sources: Kaggle and Ebirds.\n\nEbirds 2014: For Bird count, I used the Ebird Taxonomy List That lists from 2012-2023 all bird species count.

Meaning that either there are likely other factors that contribute to that, or there are no factors that change bird counts.\nWhile we did not find any correlation between air temperature and bird count, we could run another analysis that explores potential spots where bird count was miscounted due to poor view in trees.\nFor that we can run a kriging analysis, where we can run use interpolation to predict and estimate the locations of hidden birds.\n\n\n\n\n\nto start off, we can continue using our calqua_merge dataframe, as it has both x, y, and z coordinates.

Meaning that either there are likely other factors that contribute to that, or there are no factors that change bird counts.\nWhile we did not find any correlation between air temperature and bird count, we could run another analysis that explores potential spots where bird count was miscounted due to poor view in trees.\nFor that we can run a kriging analysis, where we can run use interpolation to predict and estimate the locations of hidden birds."
