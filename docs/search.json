    "section": "Purpose",
    "text": "Purpose\nIn December of 2017, The Thomas fire burned throughout Santa Barbara and Ventura county, creating distress and destructing in its wake. This wildfire was one of multiple wildfires occuring in California, making this a hotter topic throughout the years. As a native Ventura county resident, I have seen the effects this wildfire has caused in the community. Not only did I have to miss school, but my parents and I were forced to shelter indoors as the air quality grew worse. With the sky burning blood red for a few days, and smoke hazes filling up the streets of Oxnard, my curiosity grew more. Now that I have a chance to explore what exactly was going due to having data science experience, I can now vizualize the Thomas’s fire impact through air quality. My interest in collecting the air quality during this time can shed light on the correlation between wildfires and air quality. I want to investigate how the Thomas Fire impacted the AQI in Santa Barbara county using public data provided by US Environmental Protection Agency."
