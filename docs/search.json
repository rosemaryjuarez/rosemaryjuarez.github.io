    "text": "In the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), a New Deal initiative, assessed neighborhoods for real estate investment safety. The HOLC’s grading system (A for green, B for blue, C for yellow, and D for red) was then used to deny loans for home ownership, a discriminatory practice known as “redlining.” This historical injustice has affected community wealth and health. Redlined areas exhibit lower greenery levels and higher temperatures compared to other neighborhoods.\nI want to examine how this is still a current-day issue by outlining the socioeconomics of current tracts. A recent study found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity.Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that redlined neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities.
